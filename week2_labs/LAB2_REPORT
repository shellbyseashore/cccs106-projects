## Challenges and Solutions

Some of the files that shouldn't be commited were in the repository and had to redo it

## Learning Outcomes

Working on this activity was both fun and challenging. Since it was my first time, I felt a bit confused, especially when I had to connect it to my GitHub account and encountered some errors. However, through the process, I was able to learn, practice problem-solving, and eventually understand how to do it correctly. This experience taught me the value of patience and persistence in learning new tools.
